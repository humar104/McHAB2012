add the contents of the libraries directory to your Arduino IDE's libraries directory.
Then you will be able to see the ArduIMU project on the examples.
After programming the ArduIMU sketch on the ArduIMU V3 board use the PC application to see the data. 
Make sure to set the baudrate to 38400 bps.

Good luck
